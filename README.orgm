*** This Is Beta Quality Code
This code works well enough that I use it as my sole interface to NB. If you have an interest in using it, let me know or just grab the code and try it. The only configuration that is required is to put the /nbc/ directory into your path and to set the path to /nb/ at the start of the /nbc.sh/ file. 

*** NanoBlogger Command Line
I use [[http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/][NanoBlogger]], called NB by its fans, as the technology for [[http://www.neilsmithline.com][my blog]]. I'm rather happy with its simplicity. I have several [[http://neilsmithline.com/archives/blog/][blog postings]] discussing my use of NB. My biggest complaint with it is its [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface][CLI]]. No matter how much I use it, I cannot remember the syntax for commands or make my hands type them correctly. 

I'm not sure whether the difficulties I have with the NB command-line are due to the way my brain is wired, NB being limited by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backwards_compatibility][backwards compatibility]], or something else. The only thing I know is that I find it painful to use in its current form.

Unburdened from backwards compatibility, I have been writing a front-end to NB that is more intuitive; that is, more intuitive to me. The CLI actually follows a formal grammar that is defined in the rather verbose comment near the end of [[file:nbc.sh][nbc.sh]].

*** What's Missing
I have not completely rewritten the NB user interface. I have just done the parts I use. For example, I don't use or support NB's:
    - Drafts
    - Importing entries
    - Changing entries' dates
    - Queries (a very powerful feature but doesn't fit my use model)
    - Articles
    - Meta-files

*** Credits
While I like my CLI very much, it only exists because of the cool work done on [[http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/][NanoBlogger]]. As NB is doing most of the work, credit should go there.
